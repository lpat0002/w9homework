        <p>Little is known about Shakespeare's early life.
            He appears as an <span class="play_text"> amateur</span> playwright and actor in the late 1580s.
            The black plague stuck London in 1593, closing the city and its theatres for 14 months.
            Shakespeare likely returned to his home in Stratform-upon-Avon during this time.
        </p>
        <p>In 1594 he co-founds the theatre company  <span class="play_text">'Lord Chamberlain's Men' </span> and begins writing a lot more.
            He also achieves great success, becoming one of the most popular playwrights of the time.

        <p>Queen Elizabeth I dies in 1603 and is replaced with King James I. 
                Shakespeare's theatre company then becomes the  <span class="play_text">'King's Men' </span> under the patronage of the new monarch.</p>
        <p>Almost all of these datings are approximates.
                The dates are based on personal diaries of those who may have seen his plays, publishing dates, official documents and artistic style.
            </p> 
        <p>These dates are contested to this day with each scholar having different opinions.</p>

    <div class="centre"><h2>Lengths of Shakepeare's Plays</h2></div>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="column_side">
        <p>On average, every 1000 lines is 1 hour in performance.
        For example, it would take about 2 hours to perform all 2165 lines of <span class="play_text"> A Midsummer Night's Dream.</span>
        </p>    
        <p>Longer plays, like <span class="play_text"> Hamlet</span> and <span class="play_text"> Richard III</span> could take 4 hours!
            For this reason, these plays are often shortened by directors to about 2 hours.
            It is unlikely that all 4024 lines of <span class="play_text"> Hamlet</span> were performed even in Shakespeare's day.

        <p>&nbsp</p> 
        <p>Tragedies tend to be longer and more intense, while comedies are usually shorter and lighter.</p> 
        <p><span class= "play_text">Hamlet</span> is Shakespeare's longest play with much of the text dedicated to Hamlet's psychology.
        On the otherhand, <span class= "play_text">Comedy of Errors</span> is his shortest play and is full of slapstick and jokes.</p>

    <div class="centre"><h2>Settings of Shakespeare's Plays</h2></div>
    <div class="row"> 
        <div class="column_side">
            <p>Shakespeare set his plays in many different locations, mainly throughout Europe and rarely in Africa and Egypt.</p>
            <p>Italy was a very popular location for writers during Shakespeare's time.
            The Italian renaissance led to a boom in artistic exports such as poetry and short stories that became very popular in England.
            Some believe that Shakespeare travelled to Italy at some point, although there is no evidence for this.</p>

        <div class="column_side">
            <p> <span class="play_text">The Tempest</span> is the only play not included here. It takes place on a fictional island possibly in the Caribbean.</p>
            <p> <span class="play_text">Antony and Cleopatra</span> takes place in 3 different countries and 3 different continents; Italy, Egypt and Syria.</p>
            <p>It is unclear where <span class="play_text"> As You Like It</span> takes place. Arden could refer to the Arden Forest in England, or the Ardennes region in France. In this map it is included in France.</p>
